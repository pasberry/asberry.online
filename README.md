## Intro

With over 15 years of experience in software engineering, I am currently a Senior Consultant and Cloud Engineer at BJSS, specializing in AWS platform solutions. My journey in tech has also seen me thrive as a Full Stack Engineer, with proficiency in Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python. I’m passionate about building scalable, efficient, and innovative solutions that drive business success.

Outside of my professional life, I am a proud husband and father to a lovely daughter. My family and I call Brooklyn home, where we enjoy the vibrant culture and energy of New York City. When I’m not immersed in code, you can find me exploring the latest sneaker drops, hanging out with my dog and cats, or simply soaking in all that the city has to offer.
